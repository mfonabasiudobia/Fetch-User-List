# Project Description: Fetching User List and Displaying Data from "https://randomuser.me" API

## Overview

This project aims to fetch a list of users from the "https://randomuser.me" API and display their data. The Random User Generator API provides randomly generated user information, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and profile pictures. By utilizing this API, we can retrieve a diverse range of user data and showcase it in an interactive user interface.

## Features

The project will include the following features:

1. User List Fetching: The application will make a GET request to the Random User Generator API to retrieve a list of randomly generated user data. The API response will be in JSON format, containing user details such as name, email, phone number, and profile picture.

2. Data Parsing and Display: The fetched JSON response will be parsed and extracted to obtain individual user details. The application will then display the retrieved data in an organized and user-friendly format. Each user's information will be presented as a card, including their profile picture, name, email, and phone number.

3. Pagination: To manage a large number of users, the application will implement pagination. Users will be displayed in chunks or pages, with navigation controls to switch between pages. This will ensure efficient data presentation and a smoother user experience.

4. Responsive Design: The user interface will be designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. This will enable users to access and view the application seamlessly on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

The project will utilize the following technologies:

- Next.js, Tailwind Css, Typescript, Redux, Moment: To create the user interface and handle client-side interactions.
- Random User Generator API: To fetch random user data in JSON format.
- Axios: To make asynchronous HTTP requests to the API and handle the API response.
- JSON Parsing: To extract and manipulate the data obtained from the API response.
- Pagination Libraries or Techniques: To implement pagination for the user list.
- Responsive Design Techniques: To ensure the application is accessible across different devices.

## Conclusion

This project will provide an engaging and interactive user experience by fetching user data from the Random User Generator API and displaying it in a visually appealing manner. Users will be able to navigate through the list of users. By implementing responsive design principles, the application will be accessible to a wide range of users on various devices.
